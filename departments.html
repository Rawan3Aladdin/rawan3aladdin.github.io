      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p> At our school students have opportunities to learn a variety of basic numeracy skills in the junior grades and advanced university math in senior courses. We have a strong team of staff who is committed towards helping students to succeed in math.
        <br /> 'Small minds discuss persons. Average minds discuss events. Great minds discuss ideas. Really great minds discuss mathematics.'

        <h2>Sciences</h2>
        <p> In our department we are passionate about encouraging and inspiring the next generaton of scientists, doctors, nurses and engineers. We strive to provide a hands-on experience because we believe science is a process, not just a body of knowledge
          to memorize. Instead we want to engage students creativity and innovation by offering open-ended challenges and more complex problems.

            <h2>Social Studies</h2>
            <p> Social studies, as defined in the BC curriculum, is a multidisciplinary subject that draws from the social sciences and humanities to study human interaction and natural and social environments. The overarching goal of social studies is to
              develop thoughtful, responsible, active citizens who are able to acquire the requisite information to consider multiple perspectives and to make reasoned judgments. The Social Studies curriculum provides students with opportunities as future
              citizens to critically reflect upon events and issues in order to examine the present, make connections with the past, and consider the future.

              <h2>Performing Arts</h2>
              <p> Choreographers and dancers, playwrights and actors, composers and musicians . . . the performing arts department encompasses a range of disciplines. We recognize the importance of artistic development in the individual and society. This development includes creative artistic expression, technique, knowledge of the classics, a contemporary perspective, understanding of the forms, and the discipline required of all artists. It implies also an understanding and appreciation of an integrated arts program as well as of the arts of various cultures and peoples.

                <h2>Information Technology </h2>
                <p> Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have turned local communities into global communities. The kind of education that prepares students for this global community has technology as an integral part of its core. A technology-rich
                  education enables students to bridge cultural and geographical distances around specific tasks, projects, information gathering and relationship building. It makes all subjects more meaningful to students and more adequately prepares
                  them for the world in which they will live and work.
